                <p>I led the design and creative direction for a complete brand identity and a flagship print book focused on mental wellness.</p>
                <p>Color & Illustration: I developed a palette of pleasing colors—soft, desaturated tones—that evoke tranquility and calm. This was paired with <strong>calming and descriptive illustrations</strong> that translate complex emotional or psychological concepts into easily digestible, supportive visuals.</p>
                <p>Typography & Layout: I selected <strong>elegant typography</strong> that is approachable yet sophisticated, prioritizing legibility and comfort. The layout was engineered for an <strong>uninterrupted reading flow</strong>, with ample white space and considered hierarchy to prevent visual fatigue, ensuring the content is the priority.</p>
                <p>Brand Identity System: I created a complete visual identity (logo, brand guidelines, digital assets) that maintains consistency across all touchpoints, ensuring the brand voice is consistently supportive, clear, and serene.</p>
