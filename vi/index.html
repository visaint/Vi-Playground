                                <p><h3>Veoma: The Elegant Design Engine</h3>
                                At Veoma, I joined a team focused on establishing the agency as a premium boutique—an elegant workshop for high-end design. Our communal mission was to craft a definitive visual language, equal parts historic sophistication and sharp modern expertise, ensuring we attracted the right quality of clientele.
                                    <h3>What I Did</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Brand Refinements for Clients: I was tasked with giving our clients a visual edge. We often focused on interactive elements, meaningful colors, prestine typography & key differentiations for branding.</li>
                                        <li>Web Development: For customer projects, we engineered clean, direct websites with a shade of playfulness. Our focus was always on a simple, compelling user journey: show the work, clearly explain the services, and ensure the design emphasizes their unique market position. We mostly developed using website builders like Webflow, Readymag, Framer & Cargo, which looked absurdly amazing to me, then being a novice coder.</li>
                                        <li>Leading Successful Products: My biggest win came from successfully guiding projects from concept to launch.Succesfully communicating and cordinating our customer and team to success.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>What I Learned</h5>
                                  Working at Veoma was less about tools and more about the human element of design. The tight, elegant constraints we placed on our work ended up teaching me the most valuable lessons:

                                  <ul>
                                        <li>How to translate abstract client desires into actionable design sprints and keep the whole team aligned on the vision for a successful product.</li>
                                        <li>Deep customer understanding drove every design choice we made, from choosing the right typography to implementing the best visual styles.</li>
                                        <li>The Builders Trap: looking super impressive at first, they proved limiting on creativity, sadly saying no to changing wishes, instead of yes anding our customers as we alwaysshould.</li>
                                    </ul></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                            <h3>View From Nowhere (vfns): The Abstract Game Lab</h3>

                            <p>I started working at vfns, a narrative studio dedicated to converting the weirdest abstract concepts into video games. Our mission was simple: create short, low-tech, story & interaction-driven games that punch above their weight, providing a memorable experience that lingers in your mind.


                            <h3>What I Did</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Interface Architecture (UI/UX): I didn't just skin the interface; I engineered it. I focused heavily on UI design and flawless User Experience, building all the menus, interactive maps, inventory screens & heads-up displays to be perfectly intuitive and deeply immersive.</li>
                                <li>Asset Creation: This was hands-on, pixel-by-pixel work. I manually created a lot of pgame assets—from pixel assets like character sprites and environmental tiles in Aseprite, to more draditional graphic design work like video game logo designs for games like Soleil. It was a rigorous exercise in visual economy.</li>
                                <li>Game Story & Play Testing: I contributed directly to the narrative and core mechanics, collaborating on the full game story and engagement loop for multiple games. This meant laying out the foundations in a master game design doc, extensive play testing to refine the difficulty curves, lots of late night discussions to get the emotional pacing right & ensure we created an amazing product.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>What I Learned</h5>
                            <p>Working on game development was an intensive masterclass in constraint-based design. It taught me that truly great design is about anticipating every possible user action, regardless of the technology.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>UX is Everything: I learned that great UI design means nothing without flawless User Experience. In games, every millisecond of lag or confusion breaks immersion. This experience sharpened my ability to engineer interfaces that disappear when uneeded, but clear (you just know where to look) when needed.</li>
                                <li>Abstract to Play: The biggest payoff was learning how to successfully take an abstract idea and engineer it into a tight, playable game loop, confirming that the most complex concepts can be delivered through simple, low-tech execution.</li>
                                <li>Visual Discipline: Creating detailed, expressive pixel assets taught me immense discipline in color theory and graphic representation. Every single pixel must fight for its life to communicate a clear meaning.</li>
                            </ul> <h5>Plus I absolutely fell in love with pixel fonts. Clearly!</h5>
                        </div>

                            </p><h3>Doctors: The Brand Upgrade I Engineered</h3>
                            I took on Doctors, a medical brand that was a digital dinosaur—thirty years of established history, unclear brand identity, various logo versions and highly inconsistent products. My mission? Drag them into the 21st century without triggering an identity crisis among their loyal patient base.
                                                <h3>What I Did</h3>
                                                <ul>
                            <li>I didn't just do a redesign; I performed
                            a full Brand Upgrade—a deep-level system evolution.</li>
                            <li>Logo Refreshed: Added a modern refreshed serif (Playfair Display), similar enough to the previous choice (Times New Roman), but providing so much more personality and elegance. Together with sophisticated seasonal color applications, the brand is dynamic, fresh and exiting.</li>
                            <li>Visual System Overhaul: I deployed a clean, modernist approach to all marketing materials, based on Swiss Style, keeping the visuals simple, fluid, and elegant. Think of it as refactoring their entire visual library, which was early 2000s infomercial.</li>
                            <li>Scalable Product Architecture: They had so many products, in inconsystent styles, colors & even industries. I cleaned up what cold be changed, created distinct color coded categories for each, while ensuring they all fit together in a cohesive whole. I take pride in building systems, not just one-off assets.</li>
                            <li>Motion-Forward Content: I forced an emphasis on motion in video ads, highlighting product function, health benefits & distinctive packaging. Static content is not enough!</li>
                            <li>Improved Product Photography: Most pictures were janky, low resolution & poorly rendered mockups. I set up a proper set and started taking delious product photos, got friends to model & act for me and lead great digital advertising campaigns.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                 <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                            This project hammered home a core truth: it's harder to work with what is, than start over. But gosh, it can be fun. I learned how complex it can be to make a comprehensive design system, how labourius it is to work with picture, how fun a photoshoot is and how engaging directing an ad is. </div>
