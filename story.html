                        <p>I grew up obsessed with video games. Not just playing them, but exploring them like secret
                            worlds. I jumped between modern 3D universes and the charming simplicity of 8-bit pixels,
                            trying to understand why each one felt magical in its own way. As a kid, I would dive deep
                            into the history of how games were made, how stories were told through level design, and how
                            tiny artistic decisions shaped entire experiences. I loved discovering narrative tricks,
                            strange mechanics, and all the odd, clever experiments that never made it into the
                            mainstream. Video games weren't just entertainment for me — they were a limitless playground
                            of ideas. They taught me that technology, art, and emotion can combine in completely
                            unexpected ways, and I've been chasing that feeling ever since.</p>

                        <p>My love for books started with a strange pairing: Alice in Wonderland and The Picture of
                            Dorian Gray. One was surreal, whimsical, and chaotic; the other was dark, elegant, and
                            unnervingly psychological. Together they cracked something open in me. I became obsessed
                            with how stories could twist reality, reveal character, or expose hidden truths. From there
                            I started devouring everything I could get my hands on — reading nearly two books a week —
                            chasing that feeling of slipping into other worlds. Over time my habits expanded into a kind
                            of personal ritual: one fiction book to ignite imagination, one non-fiction to feed
                            curiosity. As my interests grew, the topics exploded outward — philosophy, design,
                            technology, art, psychology, mythology — each one forming a new branch of the inner library
                            I still carry with me.</p>

                        <p>Technology school was challenging in all the right ways. It pushed me into the deep end of
                            hardware, circuitry, system internals — all the things I quickly realized I didn't actually
                            care about. I respected the complexity, but it didn't spark anything in me. What did spark
                            something was software. The moment I started writing code, the whole world shifted. Software
                            felt alive — expressive, flexible, endlessly creative. I wasn't just plugging components
                            together; I was shaping behavior, building logic, designing experiences. That's where I
                            first understood that my real passion wasn't inside the machine — it was in creating what
                            the machine could do.</p>

                        <p>University was the place that demanded everything from me. Moving all the way to Slovenia
                            felt like stepping into a bigger version of myself — new people, new ideas, and a level of
                            independence I had been craving. I pushed harder than I ever had before, grinding through my
                            first year, proud of every class I passed and every connection I made. It felt like
                            momentum, like the start of something huge. And then the pandemic hit. Overnight, the world
                            shrank. Campus, friends, lectures — all of it collapsed into a single glowing rectangle. I
                            ended up back home, trying to hold onto that drive while everything around me slowed,
                            blurred, and broke in ways none of us were prepared for.</p>

                        <p>The pandemic was dark, horrible, and psychologically destructive. Everything I had been
                            building toward suddenly unraveled, and I felt stuck in a loop of uncertainty that lasted
                            far longer than I ever expected. But in the middle of all that chaos, I managed to carve out
                            a path forward. I landed a job at Business House — a company in a booming industry of
                            medical supplies and health food — and it became this strange, unexpected lifeline. There I
                            learned how to sell, how to negotiate, how to talk to clients, how to pitch ideas with
                            confidence. I even started traveling for work, discovering a version of myself I didn't know
                            existed. It didn't erase the darkness of that time, but it gave me a direction, a set of
                            skills, and a sense of resilience I still carry with me.</p>

                        <p>University taught me a lot of interesting things, but the class that changed everything was
                            modern web development. It was the first skill that felt both natural and instantly useful —
                            something I was genuinely good at. So I leaned into it. I opened a Fiverr account and
                            started freelancing, building small video games using web technologies. What began as simple
                            experiments quickly grew into full playable ads, interactive experiences, and eventually
                            websites. Every project pushed me to learn more, try more, invent more. And honestly, it was
                            amazing — the feeling of turning ideas into something real, something people could actually
                            play with, was like rediscovering the magic of games from my childhood, but this time from
                            the creator's side.</p>

                        <p>By now I've read so many books, but a few of them rewired me completely. Popism: The Warhol
                            Sixties by Andy Warhol and Pat Hackett, Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the
                            Computer that Changed Everything by Steven Levy, and Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson all hit
                            me at exactly the right moment. From Warhol, I learned how industrialized, repetitive labor
                            can still produce powerful art. From the Macintosh story, I understood how much the details
                            matter — how entire revolutions happen because someone cared enough to polish one more
                            pixel. And from Jobs, I internalized the idea that craftsmanship is emotional, personal, and
                            deeply human. Those books taught me to value how something is made far more than how much I
                            make. They shaped my philosophy, and gave me the motto I still live and work by: 'Design is
                            how it works!'</p>

                        <p>Once design clicked for me, I wanted to learn every form of it. I dove into graphic design,
                            teaching myself Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and eventually Figma — each one opening a
                            different doorway into how ideas can become visual experiences. I learned to work with
                            video, experimented with visual website builders, and kept doubling the set of tools I felt
                            comfortable creating with. Every new skill expanded the way I thought, the way I
                            communicated, the way I solved problems. It felt like assembling a creative toolkit piece by
                            piece, until suddenly I could express almost anything I imagined.</p>
