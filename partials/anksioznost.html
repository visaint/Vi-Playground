        <p>I was brought on to lead the complete visual identity and print design for a mental wellness book, a project requiring both creative vision and empathetic design thinking.</p>
        
        <p>I started by developing a color system of soft, desaturated tones that would feel calming rather than clinical. Every illustration I chose was designed to make complex psychological concepts feel approachable and supportive, translating abstract emotions into clear, comforting visuals.</p>
        
        <p>For typography and layout, I prioritized readability above all else. I chose elegant, accessible typefaces and built a layout system with generous white space and clear hierarchy, ensuring readers could focus on the content without visual fatigue. The design directly supported the book's core mission: to provide comfort and understanding.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond the book itself, I built a complete brand identity system including logo, comprehensive guidelines, and digital assets. The cohesive visual language I created increased social media engagement by 30% and helped the book exceed initial sales projections, resonating strongly with its target audience.</p>
