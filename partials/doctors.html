    <div class="project-description">
        <p>I joined a cosmetics company as their Graphic Designer, tasked with modernizing their entire visual presence across products, social media, and e-commerce. The brand felt dated and inconsistent, and my goal was to transform it into something fresh and cohesive.</p>
        
        <p>I started with a complete brand refresh. I updated the logo from Times New Roman to Playfair Display, a modern serif that brought elegance and personality while maintaining brand recognition. I introduced a seasonal color system that kept the brand feeling dynamic and exciting throughout the year.</p>
        
        <p>The visual overhaul extended to all marketing materials. I implemented a Swiss Style inspired approach with clean, minimal layouts that replaced their cluttered, early 2000s aesthetic. For their sprawling product catalog, I created a color-coded category system that organized dozens of products across multiple industries into a unified, scalable architecture.</p>
        
        <p>I also pushed for motion-first content, directing video ads that showcased product functionality and benefits. On the photography side, I set up a proper studio, directed shoots with friends as models, and replaced low-resolution mockups with professional product photography. These changes increased social media engagement by 35% and contributed to a 25% boost in e-commerce conversions within the first quarter.</p>
