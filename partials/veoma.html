        <p>I joined a team launching a premium boutique agency focused on high-end web design for luxury brands. My role spanned both creative execution and business development as we built the agency from the ground up.</p>
        
        <p>I led the creation of our agency's brand identity and website, establishing a design language rooted in classical typography and refined minimalism. This foundation became our calling card and helped position us in the premium market.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond design work, I drove client acquisition through strategic outreach and relationship building. I handled client communication from initial contact through project delivery, converting leads into long-term partnerships. Each project required custom solutions tailored to the client's specific needs and market position.</p>
        
        <p>I developed comprehensive brand identities, designed and built custom websites, and created detailed style guides for clients. My process emphasized usability testing and crafting intuitive user experiences. While I explored tools like Webflow, Framer, and Figma for rapid prototyping, I ultimately focused on custom development for projects requiring more sophisticated functionality and unique design systems.</p>
