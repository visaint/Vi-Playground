    <div class="project-description">
        <p>I joined a narrative-focused indie game studio as a UI/UX Designer, quickly expanding my role to touch nearly every aspect of the player experience. The small team environment meant wearing multiple hats and learning rapidly across disciplines.</p>
        
        <p>My initial focus was designing intuitive, genre-appropriate user interfaces that felt natural to players. I approached each screen as part of the larger player journey, ensuring menus and HUDs enhanced rather than interrupted the experience.</p>
        
        <p>As I grew into the role, I contributed to core game design including narrative pacing, progression systems, and unlock mechanics. I led playtesting sessions for every build, organizing feedback groups and translating player insights into actionable design improvements. This iterative process helped us refine the game's feel and flow.</p>
        
        <p>I also created in-game assets, working in pixel art and sourcing textures to bring the world to life. Beyond the game itself, I designed the studio's website and developed a cohesive brand identity that captured the studio's narrative-driven approach and indie spirit.</p>
