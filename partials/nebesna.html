                <p>I was hired as Creative Director for a modern e-commerce startup, responsible for building the entire brand from the ground up. The vision was to create a sophisticated, raw aesthetic that felt premium yet accessible.</p>

                <p>I led all aspects of the brand identity, from visual language to tone of voice, ensuring every touchpoint felt cohesive and intentional. For the website, I designed and developed a custom e-commerce platform using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript, prioritizing performance and user experience while keeping development costs minimal.</p>
                
                <p>All visual content was produced in-house under my direction. I handled product photography, lifestyle shots, and video content to maintain a consistent, authentic brand aesthetic. Every image reinforced the raw, sophisticated look we were building.</p>
                
                <p>I introduced a seasonal curated drop model where products were only available for limited periods. This strategy transformed the store into a dynamic, constantly evolving space that encouraged repeat visits. The approach increased customer engagement significantly and drove a 40% increase in monthly sales within the first six months.</p>
